# Virtual Android System Simulation

This project provides a Python script that simulates a virtual Android system using the BlueStacks emulator. The script can start the emulator, install an APK, and retrieve system information.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python is installed and added to your system's PATH.
- **BlueStacks Emulator**: Download and install BlueStacks from [BlueStacks Official Website](https://www.bluestacks.com/).
- **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**: ADB is usually included with the Android SDK or can be found in the BlueStacks installation directory. Ensure that ADB is accessible from your command line.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

2. ANDROID_EMULATOR_PATH = "C:/Program Files/BlueStacks_nxt/BlueStacks.exe"  # Update your BlueStacks path
   APK_PATH = "C:/path/to/sample.apk"  # Update with your APK path
